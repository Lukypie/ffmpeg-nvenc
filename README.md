Hi. This is just a the source code of the Ubuntu ffmpeg debian package, the only modification made is debian/rules and added nvenc and nonfree support with --enable-non-free and --enable-nvenc 
You can compile by yourself by installing the nvenc ffmpeg heders first 
https://github.com/FFmpeg/nv-codec-headers
Make sure to have the sources enabled on your sources.list config

sudo apt-get build-dep ffmpeg
sudo apt-get source ffmpeg

debuild -b -us -uc
inside the extracted folder to start compiling the debs

and install the .debs you compiled by removing the debug symbols one (rm *dbg.deb*) and the one with the "extra" prefix on them

You can find in "releases" the one I compiled
